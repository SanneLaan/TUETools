		<h3>Users of TUE Tools can share and download files belonging to the courses they are following. Everything what comes in handy to pass a course can be uploaded via your own account. Think of books, summaries, handouts, studyguides, etc. By creating an account you will get access to all the documents other users have uploaded, and be able to upload your own documents yourself. Build a practical library full with the files you need every exam. </h3>
